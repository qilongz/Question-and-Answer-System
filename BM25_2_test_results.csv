16,199,Where is the Center for New Religions located?,"[25, 165, 82]","In 1773, Isaac Backus, a prominent Baptist minister in New England, wrote against a state sanctioned religion, saying: ""Now who can hear Christ declare, that his kingdom is, not of this world, and yet believe that this blending of church and state together can be pleasing to him?"""
16,200,What does Wood believe the U.S. operates on?,"[166, 25, 162]","Wood believes that the U.S. operates on ""a sort of civic religion,"" which includes a generally-shared belief in a creator who ""expects better of us."""

17,0,What kind of symmetry do annelids have?,"[11, 0, 5]","In species with incomplete septa or none, the blood circulates through the main body cavity without any kind of pump, and there is a wide range of locomotory techniques – some burrowing species turn their pharynges inside out to drag themselves through the sediment."
17,1,What do annelids use to move?,"[77, 92, 79]","Many annelids move by peristalsis (waves of contraction and expansion that sweep along the body), or flex the body while using parapodia to crawl or swim."
17,2,Which subtype of annelids includes most marine worms?,"[140, 2, 18]","The rear end of the Palolo worm, a marine polychaete that tunnels through coral, detaches in order to spawn at the surface, and the people of Samoa regard these spawning modules as a delicacy."

17,8,What is movement by ripples called?,"[10, 32, 33]","The septa of such species also enable them to change the shapes of individual segments, which facilitates movement by peristalsis (""ripples"" that pass along the body) or by undulations that improve the effectiveness of the parapodia."
17,9,What movement method do some burrowing annelids use?,"[79, 12, 118]","However, the septa are often incomplete in annelids that are semi-sessile or that do not move by peristalsis or by movements of parapodia – for example some move by whipping movements of the body, some small marine species move by means of cilia (fine muscle-powered hairs) and some burrowers turn their pharynges (throats) inside out to penetrate the sea-floor and drag themselves into it."

17,15,How do earthworms help the soil they live in?,"[133, 131, 139]","The burrowers loosen the soil so that oxygen and water can penetrate it, and both surface and burrowing worms help to produce soil by mixing organic and mineral matter, by accelerating the decomposition of organic matter and thus making it more quickly available to other organisms, and by concentrating minerals and converting them to forms that plants can use more easily."
17,16,How much of near-shore marine annelids are burrowing?,"[16, 79, 175]","The burrowing of marine polychaetes, which may constitute up to a third of all species in near-shore environments, encourages the development of ecosystems by enabling water and oxygen to penetrate the sea floor."

17,37,What do non-cuticle annelids use to protect their skin?,"[36, 28, 35]","A few marine annelids that live in tubes lack cuticles, but their tubes have a similar structure, and mucus-secreting glands in the epidermis protect their skins."

17,50,What is a pharynx?,"[96, 103, 52]","In these animals the foremost few segments often lack septa so that, when the muscles in these segments contract, the sharp increase in fluid pressure from all these segments everts the pharynx very quickly."
17,51,Where are clitellates' brains?,"[53, 32, 52]","The brains of polychaetes are generally in the prostomium, while those of clitellates are in the peristomium or sometimes the first segment behind the peristomium."
