10,74,What kind of physical laws are time-reversal invariant?,[77],"Firstly, the fundamental physical laws are time-reversal invariant; if a cinematographic film were taken of any process describable by means of the aforementioned laws and then played backwards, it would still portray a physically possible process."
10,75,"If if a cinematographic film were taken by means of physical  laws and then played backwards, it would still portray what?",[77],"Firstly, the fundamental physical laws are time-reversal invariant; if a cinematographic film were taken of any process describable by means of the aforementioned laws and then played backwards, it would still portray a physically possible process."

10,78,How are things in statistical mechanics? ,[82],But in statistical mechanics things get more complicated.
10,79,What are superior to classical thermodynamics?,[83],"On one hand, statistical mechanics is far superior to classical thermodynamics, in that thermodynamic behavior, such as glass breaking, can be explained by the fundamental laws of physics paired with a statistical postulate."
10,80,"In order to explain glass breaking, Fundamental laws of physics can be paired with what? ",[83],"On one hand, statistical mechanics is far superior to classical thermodynamics, in that thermodynamic behavior, such as glass breaking, can be explained by the fundamental laws of physics paired with a statistical postulate."
10,81,Is statistical mechanics asymmetric or symmetric in regards to time-reversal?,[84],"But statistical mechanics, unlike classical thermodynamics, is time-reversal symmetric."
10,82,"What kind of law is the second law of thermodynamics, as it arises in statistical mechanics?",[85],"The second law of thermodynamics, as it arises in statistical mechanics, merely states that it is overwhelmingly likely that net entropy will increase, but it is not an absolute law."
10,83,What does the third type of solution to the problem of the direction of time argue?,[86],"A third type of solution to the problem of the direction of time, although much less represented, argues that the laws are not time-reversal symmetric."
10,84,What is are kind of nuclear force is not time-reversibile?,[87],"For example, certain processes in quantum mechanics, relating to the weak nuclear force, are not time-reversible, keeping in mind that when dealing with quantum mechanics time-reversibility comprises a more complex definition."
10,85,Time asymmetric phenomena in quantum mechanics are to few to account what kind of time-asymmetry?,[88],But this type of solution is insufficient because 1) the time-asymmetric phenomena in quantum mechanics are too few to account for the uniformity of macroscopic time-asymmetry and 2) it relies on the assumption that quantum mechanics is the final or correct description of physical processes.
10,86,Who argues that the fundamental laws of physics are laws of temporal evolution?,[90],One recent proponent of the laws solution is Tim Maudlin who argues that the fundamental laws of physics are laws of temporal evolution (see Maudlin ).
10,87,Maudlin argues that the passage of time is what kind of asymmetry?,[91],"However, elsewhere Maudlin argues: ""[the] passage of time is an intrinsic asymmetry in the temporal structure of the world..."
10,88,What grounds the distinction between sequences?,[92],"It is the asymmetry that grounds the distinction between sequences that runs from past to future and sequences which run from future to past"" [ibid, 2010 edition, p. 108]."
10,89,Whose suggestion is difficult to assess in regards to the direction of time?,[93],Thus it is arguably difficult to assess whether Maudlin is suggesting that the direction of time is a consequence of the laws or is itself primitive.
10,90,Who started the discussion within analytic philosophy on the problem of the flow of time?,[94],"The problem of the flow of time, as it has been treated in analytic philosophy, owes its beginning to a paper written by J. M. E. McTaggart."

10,92,What was McTaggart's first series called?,[96],"The first series, which means to account for our intuitions about temporal becoming, or the moving Now, is called the A-series."
10,93,"The A-Series orders events according to their being in the past, present or future and in comparison to what else?",[97],"The A-series orders events according to their being in the past, present or future, simpliciter and in comparison to each other."
10,94,What is McTaggart's second series called?,[95],"In this paper McTaggart proposes two ""temporal series""."
10,95,According to what theory is time an ordering of various realities?,[99],"According to Presentism, time is an ordering of various realities."
10,96,Presentism states that at a certain time some things do what?,[100],At a certain time some things exist and others do not.
10,97,Who believes that time is a dimension of reality on a par with the three spatial dimensions,[102],"An Eternalist, on the other hand, holds that time is a dimension of reality on a par with the three spatial dimensions, and hence that all things—past, present, and future—can be said to be just as real as things in the present."
10,98,"According to an Eternalist, what can be said to be just as real as things in the present?",[102],"An Eternalist, on the other hand, holds that time is a dimension of reality on a par with the three spatial dimensions, and hence that all things—past, present, and future—can be said to be just as real as things in the present."
10,99,"According to the Eternalist theory, what must we use to describe Homer?",[103],"According to this theory, then, Homer really does exist, though we must still use special language when talking about somebody who exists at a distant time—just as we would use special language when talking about something far away (the very words near, far, above, below, and such are directly comparable to phrases such as in the past, a minute ago, and so on)."
10,100,How similar are the positions on the persistence of objects?,[104],The positions on the persistence of objects are somewhat similar.
10,101,Who holds  that for an object to persist through time is for it to exist completely at different times?,[105],"An endurantist holds that for an object to persist through time is for it to exist completely at different times (each instance of existence we can regard as somehow separate from previous and future instances, though still numerically identical with them)."
10,102,Who holds for a thing to exist through time is for it to exist as a continuous reality?,[106],"A perdurantist on the other hand holds that for a thing to exist through time is for it to exist as a continuous reality, and that when we consider the thing as a whole we must consider an aggregate of all its ""temporal parts"" or instances of existing."
10,103,Which view is seen as conventional?,[107],"Endurantism is seen as the conventional view and flows out of our pre-philosophical ideas (when I talk to somebody I think I am talking to that person as a complete object, and not just a part of a cross-temporal being), but perdurantists have attacked this position."
10,104,Who is an example of a perdurantist?,[108],(An example of a perdurantist is David Lewis.)
10,105,How can asymmetry of causation be observed?,[110],"However, asymmetry of causation can be observed in a non-arbitrary way which is not metaphysical in the case of a human hand dropping a cup of water which smashes into fragments on a hard floor, spilling the liquid."
10,106,How many features of asymmetry in the cup example can be viewed?,[114],"This asymmetry is perceivable on account of two features: i) the relationship between the agent capacities of the human hand (i.e., what it is and is not capable of and what it is for) and non-animal agency (i.e., what floors are and are not capable of and what they are for) and ii) that the pieces of cup came to possess exactly the nature and number of those of a cup before assembling."
10,107,Asymmetry is attributable to a relation of what kind of direction?,[115],"In short, such asymmetry is attributable to the relationship between temporal direction on the one hand and the implications of form and functional capacity on the other."
10,108,"What else, besides direction, is asymmetry attributable to?",[115],"In short, such asymmetry is attributable to the relationship between temporal direction on the one hand and the implications of form and functional capacity on the other."
